## Overview

This project is a solution to the QR Code Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. It helps reinforce the fundamentals of HTML and CSS by applying them to a real-world layout. By following the given design, I was able to practice key concepts such as layout structure, flexbox, spacing, font styling, and responsiveness.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to work with spacing and how to analyze the Figma design to closely match the layout. While I wasn’t able to replicate it 100%, I gained a better understanding of the fundamentals and I’m continuing to learn and improve with each project.

### Continued development

I want to work on more projects to enhance my skills and gain a deeper understanding of how things are built. I plan to focus more on media queries and other areas of CSS to improve responsiveness and layout control. The goal is to create projects that I can fully understand and confidently build on my own.
